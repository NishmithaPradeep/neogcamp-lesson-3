            <small>November, 2022</small>
            <p>Goa is one of the smallest states in India and a thriving tourist 
                destination for both domestic and foreign tourist alike. Although it is a small state, it packs around 130 kms of coast line with large stretch of (mostly pristine and clean) beaches. The state of Goa is dived into two districts North Goa and South Goa. Both these regions attract their fare share of tourists. Mostly tourists prefer North Goa as it offers more choices and activities in terms of hotels, restaurants and night life. South Goa attracts tourists who are mostly looking for a relaxed vacation. You will either see a lot of beach huts in Goa for low end tourists or five star 
                properties for high end tourists enjoying a luxury vacation.</p>

            <h1>Dummy Blog 2 - Web Developer</h1>
            <small>November, 2022</small>
            <p>As you learn the fundamentals of web development and look to enhance your knowledge, it’s important to scour the internet to see what other people are doing and saying. While it’s great to stay up-to-date on trends through magazines and books, web development blogs provide you with an abundance of fresh, free content. Blogs have become increasingly more popular over the years and even though sports and fashion blogs led the charge at first, it’s now very likely that every topic out there has at least one blog dedicated to it.

                Web development blogs can be extremely helpful when looking to expand your knowledge in a particular web development niche. However, 
                when searching it’s easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of content that is out there. 
                How do you distinguish between good content and bad content?</p>
